better understand and improve our services. These third parties may be 
located, and use and store your Personal Information, outside of your 
jurisdiction for these purposes.<br>
      <br>

Where we permit any third parties to collect and use your Personal 
Information in accordance with the above paragraph, we will use 
reasonable efforts to ensure that such third parties only use your 
Personal Information: (i) in compliance with this Privacy Policy; and 
(ii) subject to any other instructions we give them, including any 
appropriate confidentiality and security measures that we implement.<br>
      <br>

You consent to the third party use, sharing and transfer of your 
Personal Information (both inside and outside of your jurisdiction) as 
described in this "Sharing of your Personal Information" section.<br>
      <br>

As we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliate companies 
may be acquired by a third party or re-organise our group structure. In 
these circumstances, it may be the case that your Information is 
transferred within our group and/or transferred to a third party who 
will continue to operate our services or similar services under either 
this Privacy Policy or a different privacy policy which will be notified
 to you. The party to which your Personal Information is transferred may
 be located, and use your Information, outside of your jurisdiction.<br>
      <br>

preserve or disclose your Personal Information: (i) in order to comply 
with applicable laws or regulations; (ii) in order to comply with a 
court order, subpoena or other legal process; (iii) in response to a 
request by a government authority, law enforcement agency or similar 
body (whether situated in your jurisdiction or elsewhere); or (iv) where
 we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws or
 regulations. You also agree that we or our affiliate companies may need
 to disclose your Personal Information in order to enforce the Terms of 
Service or this Privacy Policy, protect our rights, property or safety, 
or the rights, property or safety of our affiliate companies or other

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style1">A WORD ABOUT SHARED INFORMATION</span>
      <p>A number of our services enable Shared Information to be shared 
publicly with all users of that service and not just your contacts. Our 
social media services in particular are primarily designed to help you 
share Shared Information with the world, so Shared Information can be 
broadly and instantly transmitted and will remain public for as long as 
you do not delete it (and even after you delete Shared Information, it 
may still be separately cached, copied, or stored by, or remain public 
through, other users or third parties who are not affiliated with and 
not controlled by us).<br>
      <br>

Please consider carefully what you post and communicate through our services.<br>
      <br>

      <strong><font style="font-size: 14px;">COMMUNICATIONS FROM US</font></strong>
      </p>

      <br>

      <span class="style1">Newsletters and other types of communications</span>

emails, newsletters or push notifications to your device. If you no 
longer wish to receive these communications, you can do so by following 
the unsubscribe instructions in the emails we send to you, opting out of
 notifications at the device level (if available) or contacting our 
Privacy Officer.</p>

      <br>

      <span class="style1">Service-related announcements</span>
      <p>We may from time to time send you service-related announcements when 
we consider it necessary to do so (such as when we temporarily suspend 
one of our services for maintenance). You may not opt-out of these 
service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature.</p>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style1">A WORD ABOUT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>
      <p>In some jurisdictions, certain Personal Information, such as 
information about your race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical
 views or personal health, is characterised as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; and is 
subject to stricter regulation than other personal information. Please 
note that content and information that you input to our services, such 
as photographs or information about your school or social activities, 
may reveal your sensitive Personal Information to others.<br>
      <br>

We urge you to consider whether it is appropriate to communicate sensitive Personal within our services.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style1">THIRD PARTY SERVICES ON OUR SERVICES</span>
      <p>Our services may include, or they may link you to, social media or 
other services (including websites) provided by a third party. For

These third party social media or other services may be hosted by the 
relevant third party or us. Your use of any such third party services 
(whether social media services or otherwise), including any Personal 
Information you provide to such third parties, are subject to the 
relevant third party&rsquo;s own terms of services and privacy policies and 
not the Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy, so please review their 
terms carefully.<br>

any third parties, and we bear no liability for any third party use of 
any Information provided by you to them.</p>

      <p>We operate and may continue to operate servers in a number of 
jurisdictions around the world, so the server on which your Personal 
Information is used and stored may not be in your jurisdiction.<br>
      <br>

You consent to the transfer of your Personal Information (both inside 
and outside of your jurisdiction) for the purposes described in this 
Privacy Policy.<br>
      <br>

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures for the purpose
 of preventing loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure of 
Information.<br>
      <br>

In some of our services, we will use encryption technology (such as SSL)
 to protect certain sensitive Information provided by you to us.Please 
be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can 
guarantee 100% security at all times. Our systems and the communications
 networks through which you access our services may be subject to 
security breaches and failures which are due to circumstances beyond our
 reasonable control.</p>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style1">RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>
      <p>Subject to applicable laws and regulations (including as set out under the &ldquo;<strong>Sharing of your Personal Information</strong>&rdquo;
 section above), we will only retain your Personal Information for so 
long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes as set out under the &ldquo;<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong>&rdquo; section above.<br>

  <br>

Subject to applicable laws and regulations, you may have the right to 
request to receive a copy of and make any corrections to your Personal 
Information which we hold, or to request that we delete any of your 
Personal Information that is stored by us. You may direct such request 
to our Privacy Officer. We will respond to all requests made to our 
Privacy Officer under this &ldquo;<strong>Retention of your Personal Information</strong>&rdquo; section within 60 days.<br>

amend or delete, and/or change how we and the public can view and/or 
access, your Personal Information and/or Shared Information within those
 services &ndash; in which case, please log into your account with us within 
the relevant service and make the appropriate changes.<br>
      <br>

Should your account be terminated by you or us for any reason, we will 
(subject to the above paragraph) take steps to ensure that your Personal
 Information is no longer available through our services, or otherwise 
used by us, within a reasonable period of time (subject to technical 
limitations) after such account termination. However, it is important to
 note that communications made by you using our services may put your 
Personal Information in the hands of third parties that we cannot 
control &ndash; for example, if you have previously made your Personal 
Information public via our services. In some instances, we may not be 
able to delete your Personal Information and/or Shared Information from 
our services or systems &ndash; in which case we will (where reasonably 
practicable) let you know why we are unable to do so.</p>
